EiskaltDC++ is a cross-platform program that uses the Direct Connect and ADC protocol. It is compatible with other DC clients, such as the original DC from Neomodus, DC++ and derivatives. EiskaltDC++ also interoperates with all common DC hub software.

The minimum number of our patches to original DC++ kernel makes it easy to upgrade to new versions and ensures compatibility with other clients.
