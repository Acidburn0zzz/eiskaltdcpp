--- 2.2.0 2011-01-16 ---
*** common changes ***
* Completed the transition to the 0.770 kernel. Version 0.770 is conditional,
  since it's used the patches from more recent revisions. However, full
  synchronization with lastest DC++ kernel is not planned because of some
  of its shortcomings. For example: 1) a deeper connection to libboost;
  2) using of the code, which requires -std=c++0x and gcc >= 4.5.x;

  will be simultaneously available to other users for downloading. By default
  this option is disabled, because it can cause a violation of compatibility
  with other DC-clients.
  (see discussion: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxdcpp/bug/311818)
* Note: when upgrading to this version of program, after restarts, it will be
  forced once fully rehashing your files. This is due to the fact that now file
