--- 2.1.0 2010-11-15 ---
*** common changes ***
* libeiskaltdcpp library was separated from the basic binary file for unix-like systems.
* Added localization of kernel messages. Gettext used.
* Added ability to use Lau-scripts (see the file INSTALL).
* Added ability to use miniUPnP for connection (see file INSTALL).
* Added set of sound files from the FlylinkDC++ project.
* Kernel (dcpp) was partially updated to version 0.777.
* Added NATT (see http://www.adcportal.com/wiki/index.php/NATT_-_NAT_traversal)
* Made case-sensitive share (CaseSensitiveFilelist option in SettingManager). If you have directories in which located are files of file.txt, FILE.txt and/or File.txt, now it will not cause problems with the permanent updating of the share and all these files will be simultaneously available to other users for downloading. Note: when you enable this option in program, it will be forced once fully rehashing your files. By default this option is disabled, because it can cause a violation of compatibility with other DC-clients. (see discussion: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxdcpp/bug/311818)

* Now when you hide main menu (Ctrl+M), the corresponding button will be added to the toolbar.
* Added ability to customize the list of actions on toolbar. (Right click on toolbar --> Customize)
